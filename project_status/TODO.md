# Project To-Do List

This document tracks the pending tasks and future development roadmap for the OpenExpress application.

##  Backend (Node.js & Python)

- [ ] **Database Integration:**
  - [ ] Set up a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) for the Node.js auth server.
  - [ ] Create a user model to store profile information and access/refresh tokens from OAuth providers.
  - [ ] Modify Passport.js `verifyCallback` functions to find or create users in the database.

- [ ] **API Enhancements:**
  - [ ] Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) generation upon successful login to securely authenticate frontend requests.
  - [ ] Create API endpoints that use the stored social media access tokens (e.g., `/api/post/twitter`, `/api/post/facebook`).
  - [ ] Secure the Python server's `/api/save-design` endpoint using the JWT generated by the Node server.

- [ ] **Production Readiness:**
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging for all endpoints.
  - [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL for the Node.js server (required for production OAuth).
  - [ ] Add token refresh logic for OAuth providers that support it.

## Frontend (React)

- [ ] **Implement Core Features:**
  - [ ] Build out the content panels for `Templates`, `Text`, `Images`, and `Shapes`.
  - [ ] Allow elements from these panels to be added to the main `Canvas`.
  - [ ] Make the `Canvas` interactive (select, move, resize, edit elements).

- [ ] **Implement Developer Features:**
  - [ ] Develop the `Collaboration` panel (e.g., real-time cursors, comments).
  - [ ] Build the `Version Control` panel to show a history of design changes.

- [ ] **Connect UI to Backend:**
  - [ ] Implement functionality for the `Share` and `Export` buttons in the `Header`.
  - [ ] Connect the `RightPanel` to save and load design properties (layers, colors, fonts) via the backend API.
  - [ ] Fetch and display saved designs.

## DevOps & Deployment

- [ ] **Containerization:**
  - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Node.js authentication server.
  - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Python API server.
  - [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all services (frontend, backend servers, database).

- [ ] **Build Process:**
  - [ ] Set up a production build process for the React application.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for the frontend to point to a deployed backend URL instead of `localhost`.
