# Project To-Do List

This document tracks the pending tasks and future development roadmap for the OpenExpress application.

## Backend (Node.js & Python)

- [ ] **Implement API Business Logic (in `/server/api/`):**
  - [ ] Fill in the function logic in `server/api/meta.js` to post videos to Facebook Pages and Groups using stored user tokens.
  - [ ] Implement the tweet posting functionality in `server/api/twitter.js`.
  - [ ] Implement the profile posting logic in `server/api/linkedin.js`.
  - [ ] Complete the user info fetching logic in `server/api/tiktok.js`.
  - [ ] Implement token refresh logic within these API files or `database.js` for providers that support it.

- [ ] **Complete API Security:**
  - [ ] Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) generation in `auth.js` upon successful login.
  - [ ] Complete the JWT verification logic in the placeholder `server/middleware/auth.js`.
  - [ ] Secure the Python server's `/api/save-design` endpoint by requiring and validating the JWT generated by the Node server.

- [ ] **File-Based Database (`database.js`):**
  - [ ] Implement robust error handling for file read/write operations.
  - [ ] Add a backup/snapshot mechanism for the `db.json` file to prevent data loss.

- [ ] **Production Readiness:**
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling and logging for all API endpoints.
  - [ ] Configure HTTPS/SSL for the Node.js server (required for production OAuth).

## Frontend (React)

- [ ] **Implement Core Features:**
  - [ ] Build out the content panels for `Templates`, `Text`, `Images`, and `Shapes`.
  - [ ] Allow elements from these panels to be added to the main `Canvas`.
  - [ ] Make the `Canvas` interactive (select, move, resize, edit elements).

- [ ] **Implement Developer Features:**
  - [ ] Develop the `Collaboration` panel (e.g., real-time cursors, comments).
  - [ ] Build the `Version Control` panel to show a history of design changes.

- [ ] **Connect UI to Backend:**
  - [ ] Implement functionality for the `Share` and `Export` buttons in the `Header`.
  - [ ] Connect the `RightPanel` to save and load design properties (layers, colors, fonts) via the backend API.
  - [ ] Fetch and display saved designs.
  - [ ] Create UI components that call the new backend APIs (e.g., a "Post to X" modal).

## DevOps & Deployment

- [ ] **Containerization:**
  - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Node.js authentication server.
  - [ ] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Python API server.
  - [ ] Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to orchestrate all services. Ensure a volume is used for `db.json` to persist data across container restarts.

- [ ] **Build Process:**
  - [ ] Set up a production build process for the React application.
  - [ ] Configure environment variables for the frontend to point to a deployed backend URL instead of `localhost`.

## Future Considerations / Potential Upgrades

- [ ] **Migrate to a Full-Scale Database:**
  - [ ] As the application scales, consider migrating from the file-based `db.json` to a more robust database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.
  - [ ] This would involve:
    - [ ] Setting up the database instance (e.g., in a Docker container).
    - [ ] Creating a user model/schema to store profile information and tokens.
    - [ ] Replacing the `database.js` logic with a database client (e.g., `node-postgres`, `mongoose`).
